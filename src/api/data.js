      "ATLA is set in a world where human civilization consists of four nations, named after the four classical elements: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation and the Air Nomads. In each nation, certain people, known as 'masters' (water, earth, fire and air masters), have the ability to manipulate and control telekinetically the element corresponding to their nation, using gestures based on the Chinese martial arts. The Avatar is the only person with the ability to bend all four elements. The Avatar is an international arbiter whose duty is to maintain harmony between the four nations and act as a mediator between humans and spirits. When the Avatar dies, his spirit is reincarnated into a new body, which will be born of parents in the next nation in a set order known as the Avatar cycle. By tradition, a new Avatar will travel the world to learn the four arts of bending, after which he will begin in earnest his role as a global peacemaker. The Avatar may enter a condition known as the 'Avatar State', in which they temporarily acquire the skills and knowledge of all their past incarnations. Although this is when the Avatar is most powerful, if the Avatar were to be killed while in the Avatar State, the cycle of reincarnation would end and the Avatar would never be reborn again.",

    title: "The Air Nomads",
    information:
      "Although the Air Nomads have a nomadic life, and constantly travel around the world, the temples serve them as places of worship and meeting. They are not considered cities, nor forts, since they do not possess defense mechanisms, like weapons of war, and are inhabited by monks of the same gender, so they do not possess a complex social structure like marriage. The four temples, however, are protected by their inaccessibility, because of the height and the mountains that surround them. The Air Nomads were characterized by being the only nation in which all its members controlled the air (Eoloquinesis), which they called Air-Control. The Air Masters used the defensive mostly, dodging and evading, and had a peaceful and sociable method. Twelve years after Avatar Roku's death, Fire Lord Sozin exterminated all the Air Masters, in his insistence on erasing the Avatar from the planet. He did not succeed however, for ironically, the person he was looking for was the only one who was saved. Today, Aang, his Sons Bumi and Tenzin and Tenzin's sons, Jinora, Ikki and Meelo are the only known Airbenders.",

    title: "The Water Tribes",
    information:
      "Located in the poles of the planet, there are two of them: the Northern Water Tribe and the Southern Water Tribe. There are also a small number of Water Masters located in the swamps of the Earth Kingdom, called the Swamp Water Tribe. The tribes are home to men and women, some of whom can control water, which they call Water-Control (Hydrokinesis). Those who use it are called waterbenders. Waterbenders use their opponent's strength against them and can easily adapt to different situations. The Water Tribe owes their strength to the Spirit of the Moon, and their life to the Spirit of the Ocean, they become vulnerable when the Spirits die or are gone.",

    title: "The Earth Kingdom",
    information:
      "It is considered one of the most powerful among the Four Nations. It is composed of a huge continent taking almost the whole Eastern Hemisphere of the planet. Some people of the kingdom can control the earth, which they call Earth-Control (Geokinesis). Their control is due to waiting and sound. People of the Earth Kingdom are very strong and united, able to solve anything with hope, perhaps the most resistant to the attacks of the Fire Nation. The Earth Kingdom and the Earth element are connected, as The Earth Kingdom, an Earth Master is firm, constantly hard, and must always wait for the perfect moment to attack. The Earth Kingdom is very extensive, with Omashu and Ba Sing Se being the most recognized metropolises.",

It is inhabited by many peoples and a great center. Some people of this nation control the fire, which they call Fire-Control (pyrokinesis), these people are called Fire-Masters. Some Fire Masters have the ability to create blue fire and lightning. Firebenders use only the offensive, remain direct, and seek any means to achieve their goals. After the end of the war, the Fire Nation is ruled by Fire Lord Zuko.",
